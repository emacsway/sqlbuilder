SQLBuilder

Contains 2 separated SQLBuilders:

1. Fork from py-smart-sql-constructor http://code.google.com/p/py-smart-sql-constructor/ (modified).
2. Separate slightly SQLBuilder from SQLObject ORM http://sqlobject.org/ to be used without the rest of the library (not modified).

sqlbuilder.py license is BSD, rest files (from SQLObject) - LGPL.
